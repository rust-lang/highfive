Highfive
========

This repository is no longer running on rust-lang infrastructure; instead the
relevant code lives in [triagebot](https://github.com/rust-lang/triagebot).
This repository has been archived to retain it for the future.

----

GitHub hooks to provide an encouraging atmosphere for new
contributors. Highfive assigns pull requests to users based on rules
in configuration files. You can see Highfive in action in several Rust
repositories. See the [rust-lang/rust pull
requests](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pulls), for example.

This project drives the [@rust-highfive][] bot and was originally a fork of
[servo/highfive][], used by Servo and Servo's [@highfive][] bot.  For more
history see the comments in [#35][].

Installation
=======

To install `highfive`, you just need to execute the `setup.py` script or use
`pip` directly. Both commands have to be executed from the directory where
`setup.py` is located.

    $ python setup.py install

or

    $ pip install . # the dot is important ;)


Testing
=======

Before running tests, make sure the test-requirements are installed by running the following command:

    $ pip install -r test-requirements.txt


Once the dependencies are installed, you can run all tests by
executing:

    $ pytest

Tests are labeled as "unit", "integration", and "hermetic". All unit
tests are hermetic, but only some integration tests are hermetic. A
non-hermetic test makes network requests. To run only hermetic tests
do:

    $ pytest -m hermetic

Hermetic tests are run in PR builds. All tests are run in daily cron
builds.

Adding a Project
================

To make rust-highfive interact with a new repo, add a configuration file in
`highfive/configs`, with a filename of the form `reponame.json`. The file should look like:

```
{
    "groups":{
        "all": ["@username", "@otheruser"],
        "subteamname": ["@subteammember", "@username"]
    },
    "dirs":{
        "dirname":  ["subteamname", "@anotheruser"]
    },
    "contributing": "http://project.tld/contributing_guide.html",
    "expected_branch": "develop",
    "mentions": {
        "src/doc": {
            "message": "Documentation was changed.",
            "reviewers": ["@DocumentationReviewPerson"]
        },
        "test.rs": {
            "message": "Some changes occurred in a test file.",
            "reviewers": ["@TestReviewPerson"]
        }
    },
    "new_pr_labels": ["S-waiting-for-review"]
}
```

The `groups` section allows you to alias lists of usernames. You should
specify at least one user in the group "all". Other keys are optional.

In the `dirs` section, you map directories of the repository to users or
groups who're eligible to review PRs. This section can be left
blank.

`contributing` specifies the contribution guide link in the message which
welcomes new contributors to the repository. If `contributing` is not
present, [the contributing chapter of the rustc-dev-guide][rustcontrib]
will be linked instead.

If PRs should be filed against a branch other than `master`, specify the
correct destination in the `expected_branch` field. If `expected_branch` is
left out, highfive will assume that PRs should be filed against `master`. 
The bot posts a warning on any PR that targets an unexpected branch.

The `mentions` section is used by Highfive when new PRs are
created. If a PR diff modifies files in the paths configured in the
`mentions` section, a comment is made with the given message that
mentions the specified users. Mentions paths have either one or two
behaviors.
- Every path in a diff is checked whether it begins with a path in the
  mentions list. If there is a match, the mention comment is made.
- If a path in the diff ends with a mentions path ending in `.rs`, the
  mention is a match, and a comment is made.

`new_pr_labels` contains a list of labels to apply to each new PR. If it's left
out or empty, no new labels will be applied.

Enabling a Repository
---------------

Once the PR updating the repository configuration has been merged, run the
`update-webhooks.py` script at the root of this repository:

```
$ python3 update-webhooks.py
```

The script requires the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to be set to a
valid GitHub API token, and it will make sure the configuration of all the
repositories you have admin access to is correct.

Local Development
-----------------

You can run Highfive on your machine and configure a repository to use
your local instance. Here is one approach for running a local server:

- Create a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) to isolate the
  Python environment from the rest of the system, and install highfive in it:
  ```
  $ virtualenv -p python2 env
  $ env/bin/pip install -e .
  ```
- Run the highfive command to start a development server on port 8000:
  ```
  $ env/bin/highfive
  ```
- Your Highfive instance will need to be reachable from outside of your
  machine. One way to do this is to use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to get a
  temporary domain name that proxies to your Highfive instance. Additionally,
  you will be able to use ngrok's inspector to easily examine and replay the
  requests.
- Set up the webhook by following the instructions in [Enabling a
  Repo](#enabling-a-repo), substituting your local Highfive IP address
  or domain name and port number (if necessary).
- Obtain an OAuth token. In the account you are creating the token in,
  go to https://github.com/settings/tokens. Grant access to the repository scope.
- Put the authorization information obtained in the previous step into a file
  named `.env` in the top of the repository (i.e., the directory containing
  this file). Here is a template of what it should look like:
  ```
  HIGHFIVE_GITHUB_TOKEN=your-token
  ```
  _Do not check in this file or commit your OAuth token to a
  repository in any other way. It is a secret._

Here are some details to be aware of:

- For Highfive to know how to select reviewers for your repository,
  you need a configuration file in
  [highfive/configs](/highfive/configs).
- Highfive ignores comments from the integration user near the top of
  `new_commment` in [highfive/newpr.py](/highfive/newpr.py).

Docker
------

Alternatively, you can build a Docker image that runs Highfive.

```
$ docker build -t highfive .
```

To run a container, you must mount a config file. Assuming you are
launching a container from a directory containing a config file, you
can do the following.

```
$ docker run -d --rm --name highfive -p 8000:80 -e HIGHFIVE_GITHUB_TOKEN=token -e HIGHFIVE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=secret highfive
```

At this point, Highfive is accessible at http://localhost:8080.
